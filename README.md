This is my VetsInTech Web Development project.

I scraped the data from GamesToGrunts.com and wrote to a JSON file. I only selected the games that are not sold out so visitors won't be redirected to sold out games they cannot get. Then I used Semantic UI for the layout, JavaScript to parse the JSON file, and HTML/CSS to display the content. I put the games in the first tab

In the second tab I put the solutions to the Accumulator Exercise that I finished, from 1 to 27, and the rest will be done after. I also did syntax highlighting for the code to make it easier to read. Some of the problems I have 2 solutions so visitors can pick which solution they like.
